### hi, everyone!
My name is **Diego Restrepo**, i'm a coder from Bogot√°, Colombia. Currently i'm studing at university Francisco Jos√© de Caldas and i'm working in SIIGO S.A.S.

I enjoy make code with **Java** and **js** (and in my free time i'm coding with **c#** with unity) although also i have some basic experience in python, **c++** and php and some frameworks from **CSS** like **bootstrap 5**. Alongside my  university studies, i'm also learning advance skills for coding in full stack CodeCamp from fedesoft.

I like play classic guitar and video games in my free time, and i like to think how were those videogames coding.
