### hi, everyone!
My name is *Diego Restrepo*, i'm a coder from Bogotá, Colombia. Actually i'm studing at university Francisco José de Caldas and i'm working in SIIGO S.A.S.

i enjoy make code with **Java** and **js** (and in my free time i'm coding with **c#** with unity) althoug also i have some basic experience in python, **c++** and php and some frameworks from **CSS** like bootstrap 5. Alongside my  university studies, i'm also learning advance skills for coding in full stack CodeCamp from fedesoft.

I like play classic guitar and play video games in my free time, and i like think how were those videogames coding.
